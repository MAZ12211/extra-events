There were moments where I wanted to add a specifc camera effect in my charts
but couldn't so I made this
Plan: Have camera shaders such as vignete and bloom and chromatic scale and Film Grain and Lens (Not too sure about the last two)

All of them has to support easing and the time should be steps instead of seconds
All of them should be in CamGame (maybe make it a choice later on?)

Event properties
Vignete:
- Intensity
- Easing type
- Length in steps

Bloom:
- Intensity
- Easing type
- Length in steps

Chroma:
- Intensity
- Easing type
- Length in steps

Since I'm having trouble with shaders, I went for simpler events
that I or others may need such as camera rotation and camera shake event
I should do a fade in/out camera effect too with colors

Couldn't do it with colors lol, we'll stick with the common color which is black
I should also do camera flash event sticking with the white color and maybe a toggle to have the red color too as it's somewhat common

I think I'm okay with this one, current events are in and work fine
